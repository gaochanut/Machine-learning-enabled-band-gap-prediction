# Machine learning-enabled band gap prediction

This is the repository of the ML code and data needed for reproducing the results of the paper "Machine learning-enabled band gap prediction of monolayer transition metal chalcogenide alloys"

To view the machine learning model, please open main.py. To obtain its performance metrics or to obtain the parity plot, simply execute main.py. Please ensure tensorflow 2.0 has been properly installed prior to running the code.

To reproduce the figures for the bowing parameters of band gaps in monolayer TMD alloys, please run predict.py.
